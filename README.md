# NLPJeopardy
DSCI D590 Natural Language Processing Group 4

The purpose of this project is to create a webapp that will utilize natural language processing techniques to assist trivia enthusiasts by providing relevant quiz questions for the user to answer. This allows the user to tailor their own personal trivia experience by typing in a topic and our algorithm will choose similar questions from a large dataset of previous Jeopardy clues ran on the titular TV show.
